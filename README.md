Debug the Word is a programmer‑themed word scramble game where logic meets speed. Players must unscramble coding‑inspired words, “debug” the puzzle, 
and race against time to climb the leaderboard. Each solved word boosts your score, challenging you to beat the highest record while sharpening both vocabulary and problem‑solving skills.
